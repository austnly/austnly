- 👋 Hi, I’m Austin, aka @austnly
- 🦷 I'm an ex-tooth fixer pivoting to coding, and I love creating new things with code!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web dev, including HTML, SCSS, JS, and more. I've also dabbled in Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can bring together health or personal finance/FIRE and code!
- 📫 Reach me on LinkedIn at [@austin-ly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-ly/) or email me at hello@astnly.com
